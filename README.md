# Flights-Exercises
In this code, data from flights.csv, airlines.csv, and airports.csv is imported, and using Spark SQL, departure delays are analyzed, along with the number of airports by U.S. state, displayed on a choropleth map. A daily flight and delay summary is also created, followed by bar and pie charts showing flight counts per airline.
